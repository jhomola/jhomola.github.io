<p align="justify">Hi! I am Jonathan Homola, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the <a href="https://polisci.ucla.edu" target="_blank">University of California, Los Angeles</a>. I am a comparativist and a political methodologist. Most of my substantive research deals with questions of representation and electoral preferences. More specifically, my work mostly falls into two main fields of interest: i) xenophobia and (support for right-wing) extremism, and ii) gender and politics. My regional areas of expertise are Western democracies and Eastern Europe. Methodologically, I am interested in Bayesian research methods, survival models, survey methodology, and causal inference. My work across these different fields has led to multiple <a href="http://jhomola.com/research">publications</a> including papers in the American Political Science Review, the Journal of Politics, Political Analysis, the British Journal of Political Science, and Comparative Political Studies.</p>

<p align="justify">Before coming to UCLA, I completed my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/polwiss/index.html" target="_blank">Freie Universit√§t Berlin</a> in 2011, obtained a Master's degree at the <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/government/" target="_blank">University of Essex</a> in 2013, received my PhD from <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a> in 2018, and was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at <a href="https://politicalscience.rice.edu" target="_blank">Rice University</a>. In Spring 2018, I was also a visiting student at <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">IQSS</a>.</p>
